<h4 class="noborder hd bold">IMPORTANT</h4>
<p><em>
  The Open Source conversion is not finished, mainly because I am not done with the project just yet, which will explain why some info is missing, such as where to get things from (I will be putting everything the site uses onto one platform), and the clean code. I will be adding all this soon, as well as an easy copy and paste template you should add to your site to support everything as mentioned above. This will most likely be finished around June of 2025

<div class="section">
<h3 id="pInfo" class="noborder hd bold">Project Information</h3>
  <p>S is a giant static website designed to provide visiters with many interactive activites as possible (yes, this is how they will be identified as.), all in one place, without any advertising in place.</p>
  <p>If you do decide to continue this, or take from this, I'd appreciate if you kept the same values as the original (no advertising, pro-acs, etc.)</p>
  <p>This project was designed to allow others that discovered it, to enjoy a stable experience. However I can only confirm this site was used by two people, but maybe more used it.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="pOutcome" class="noborder hd bold">Project Outcome</h3>
  <p>It was a time passing project that provided me something to do in my freetime, that also allowed me to learn a bit more about web development (mostly JS and CSS) that has been used in other projects since this.</p>
  <p>This project allowed me to learn more about flex, getting data from json files, using special window open methods, using iFrames in a special way, finding ways to insert information from other locations on a static website, using LocalStorage, Making site settings, ripping assets, editing assets, and more.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="hProject" class="noborder hd bold">Hosting the Project</h3>
  <p>The project and the projects additional resoures fall under an MIT License. All I ask for you is to give me credit, I also ask that you give credit to those that deserve it as well, such as places I got assets from, and those who helped me make this project possible.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="hRec" class="noborder hd bold">Hosting Recommendations</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Use obfuscation/encryption/encoding when needed</li>
    <li>Use other terms in place of keywords</li>
    <li>Using javascript to insert elements onto the page can help if your trying to stop something from detecting things</li>
    <li>Use special launching methods to avoid the site url from showing up on unwanted places</li>
    <li>Don't make it obvious what it is, add something that looks normal!</li>
  </ol>
