<p>S is a giant static website designed to provide visiters with many interactive activites as possible (yes, this is how they will be identified as.), all in one place, without any advertising in place.</p>
<p>If you do decide to continue this, or take from this, I'd appreciate if you kept the same values as the original (no advertising, pro-acs, etc.)
