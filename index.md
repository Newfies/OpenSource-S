<s><h4 class="noborder hd bold">IMPORTANT</h4></s>
<p><em><s>
  The open-source conversion is not yet complete, mainly because the project itself is still in progress. This explains why some information is currently missingâ€”such as where to obtain certain resources. I plan to host everything the site uses on a single platform. Clean, organized code and a simple copy-and-paste template to support all features will also be added. I expect to have everything finished by June 2025. Everything has been packed into one repository, which is quite large (over 5GB). All unnecessary and unused files have already been removed.

<h3 id="pInfo" class="noborder hd bold">Project Information</h3>
  <p>S (the website doesn't exactly have a name, its called station on GH but it was more of like a placeholder name) is a giant static website designed to provide visiters with many interactive activites as possible (yes, this is how they will be identified as.), all in one place, without any advertising in place.</p>
  <p>If you do decide to continue this, or take from this, I'd appreciate if you kept the same values as the original (no advertising, pro-acs, etc.)</p>
  <p>This project was designed to allow others that discovered it, to enjoy a stable experience. However I can only confirm this site was used by two people (I didn't share the url), but maybe more used it.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="pOutcome" class="noborder hd bold">Project Outcome</h3>
  <p>It was a time passing project that provided me something to do in my freetime, that also allowed me to learn a bit more about web development (mostly JS and CSS) that has been used in other projects since this.</p>
  <p>This project allowed me to learn more about flex, getting data from json files, using special window open methods, using iFrames in a special way, finding ways to insert information from other locations on a static website, using LocalStorage, Making site settings, ripping assets, editing assets, and more.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="hProject" class="noborder hd bold">Hosting the Project</h3>
  <p>S and the projects additional resoures fall under an MIT License. All I ask for you is to give me credit, I also ask that you give credit to those that deserve it as well, such as places I got assets from, and those who helped me make this project possible.</p>

    <li>Use special launching methods to avoid the site url from showing up on unwanted places</li>
    <li>Don't make it obvious what it is, add something that looks normal!</li>
