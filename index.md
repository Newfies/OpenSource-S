<h3 id="pInfo" class="noborder hd bold">Project Information</h3>
<p>S is a giant static website designed to provide visiters with many interactive activites as possible (yes, this is how they will be identified as.), all in one place, without any advertising in place.</p>
<p>If you do decide to continue this, or take from this, I'd appreciate if you kept the same values as the original (no advertising, pro-acs, etc.)
<p>This project was designed to allow others that discovered it, to enjoy a stable experience. However I can only confirm this site was used by two people, but maybe more used it. It was a time passing project that provided me something to do in my freetime, that also allowed me to learn a bit more about web development (mostly JS and CSS) that has been used in other projects since this.</p>
